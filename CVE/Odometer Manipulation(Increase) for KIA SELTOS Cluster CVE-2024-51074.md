# CVE-2024-51074

## Description
The KIA Seltos vehicle's CAN communication system lacks adequate security measures, making it vulnerable to exploitation. This vulnerability allows an attacker to tamper with and manipulate the odometer readings by targeting the instrument cluster through the unsecured CAN network.

## Impact
Manipulating odometer readings can have significant consequences across various domains, including vehicle safety, financial fraud,legal compliance and insurance fraud. 

## Exploitation Details
As mentioned in Reconnisance section, we followed black box approach. To find out the responsible CANIDs for different functionalities of cluster we bruteforced all the possible CANIDs range
i.e from 000 -0x7ff. This gave us set of CANIDs responsible for different functionalities.
Out of which the CANID which was more interesting was 0x386. On performing random fuzzing on CANID 0x386 we observed that the vehicle speed data was changing randomly on cluster and if fuzzing performed 
continusouly the odometer value also getting increamented ..whola!!!
we can see in below images the odometer reading before and after the attack.
