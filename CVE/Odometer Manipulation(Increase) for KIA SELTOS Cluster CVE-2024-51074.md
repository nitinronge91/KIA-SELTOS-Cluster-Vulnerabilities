# CVE-2024-51074

## Description
The KIA Seltos vehicle's CAN communication system lacks adequate security measures, making it vulnerable to exploitation. This vulnerability allows an attacker to tamper with and manipulate the odometer readings by targeting the instrument cluster through the unsecured CAN network.

## Impact
Manipulating odometer readings can have significant consequences across various domains, including vehicle safety, financial fraud,legal compliance and insurance fraud. 

## Exploitation Details
As outlined in the reconnaissance phase, a black-box testing approach was utilized. To identify the specific CAN IDs associated with various functionalities of the vehicle's instrument cluster, we performed a brute-force test over the complete standard CAN ID range (0x000 to 0x7FF). This process helped us determine a set of CAN IDs linked to different operations of the cluster.

Among the identified CAN IDs, one particularly notable ID was 0x386. Upon conducting random fuzzing tests on this CAN ID, we observed that the vehicle speed data displayed on the instrument cluster began to change erratically. With continued fuzzing, it was further noted that the odometer reading started incrementing as well.

This discovery highlighted a critical vulnerability. The images below illustrate the odometer reading before and after the attack, clearly demonstrating how the odometer can be manipulated via this method.

## Attack confirmation via UDS service
We performed pen test on UDS protocol of cluster also.during that we got confirmation of odometer reading manipulation attack via UDS service.
We read all the supported DID(Data Identifier) by using UDS service 'Read data by identifier($22)' again as it was black box testing we fuzzed all the 2 bytes data range for supported DIDs.
Read all the DIDs before and after applying above attack and the only difference in the read data was for identifier '0x0080'.
the last few bytes of DID 0x0080 was changed and for confirmation we converted hex value to decimal and whoooo... !!
Converted decimal value is same as odometer reading on cluster! so, it is confirmed that DID 0x0080 is used to store the odometer reading in non volatile memory.
below image of UDS operation shows the odometer value stored in the cluster's non volatile memory before and after attack.
