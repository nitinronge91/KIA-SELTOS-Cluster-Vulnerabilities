# CVE-2024-51074

## Description
The KIA Seltos vehicle's CAN communication system lacks adequate security measures, making it vulnerable to exploitation. This vulnerability allows an attacker to tamper with and manipulate the odometer readings by targeting the instrument cluster through the unsecured CAN network.

## Impact
Manipulating odometer readings can have significant consequences across various domains, including vehicle safety, financial fraud,legal compliance and insurance fraud. 

## Exploitation Details
As outlined in the reconnaissance phase, a black-box testing approach was utilized. To identify the specific CAN IDs associated with various functionalities of the vehicle's instrument cluster, we performed a brute-force test over the complete standard CAN ID range (0x000 to 0x7FF). This process helped us determine a set of CAN IDs linked to different operations of the cluster.

Among the identified CAN IDs, one particularly notable ID was 0x386. Upon conducting random fuzzing tests on this CAN ID, we observed that the vehicle speed data displayed on the instrument cluster began to change erratically. With continued fuzzing, it was further noted that the odometer reading started incrementing as well.

This discovery highlighted a critical vulnerability. The images below illustrate the odometer reading before and after the attack, clearly demonstrating how the odometer can be manipulated via this method.
